# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project focuses on building the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL. The goal is to create a functional API that interacts with a MySQL database, allowing for the management of categories, products, and tags.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

The project satisfies the following acceptance criteria:

- Configures a functional Express.js API that uses Sequelize to connect to a MySQL database.
- Allows the connection to the database using environment variables for database name, MySQL username, and password.
- Creates and seeds a development database with test data using schema and seed commands.
- Starts the server and syncs Sequelize models to the MySQL database.
- Provides API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, and tags that display data in formatted JSON.
- Allows successful testing of API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia for creating, updating, and deleting data in the database.

## Mock-Ups

Mock-ups demonstrate the functionality of the application, showcasing its various routes being tested in Insomnia.
